        <item>Brongo generates leads using a different marketing strategy and these leads are passed to you and to other brokers based on the micromarket. Once a lead is passed, you will receive an alert on your phone, if you are confident of closing the requirement, you accept it and get connected with the client.\n

*Note: To receive leads, make sure your status is in “Active mode” You can hold a maximum of 3+3 leads.
</item>

</item>
        <item>Yes, there is a lead limit:\n
Maximum you can hold is 3+3 leads.
</item>
        <item>No action will be taken by Brongo until you exceed the time frame. Later you will recieve a call from brongo to resolve the issue of you not accepting the lead. We believe every lead is an opportunity, so capitalize with maximum number of leads or if you think something is wrong with the client’s requirement then reject it and give your feedback. It will help brongo to inform the client about where they are going wrong.
</item>
        <item>Brongo generates leads using a different medium of marketing and these leads are categorised based on the micro market. After categorisation, these leads are sent to all the brokers who come under that specific micro market. Every broker will recieve a notification with all necessary requirements and based on the brokers capability they can accept or reject the lead. If you accept the lead then only client\'s personal details will be shared with you. If you reject it then you will see a popup asking for the reason of rejection.
</item>
