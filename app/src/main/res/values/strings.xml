    <string name="understand_rating">Ratings allow us to ensure a great
experience with Brongo for both broker and client. Just like you rate client, client can rate broker on scale of 1-5 Stars after each deal closure.</string>
    <string name="rating_calculation">Your rating is an average of the rating you’ve received from client, and is measure out of 5 stars. Ratings are anonymous, so neither you nor your client will ever see an individual rating you’ve
received. Very few people have a perfect rating. So don’t despair if your average isn’t 5.0. Things that seem small to you can matter to your Client – it’s easy to accidentally be late for a meeting. Knowing a little more about the things that affect a client’s happiness can help you be a 5-start client.</string>
    <string name="rating_quality">Clients appreciate those brokers who carry below qualities:
- Good Local Knowledge.
- Always on time
- Great attitude
- Organised
- Good negotiator
- Great advisor
- Professionalism</string>
    <string name="rating_matters">Ratings foster mutual respect between brokers and clients. This strengthens our community and helps everyone get the most from Brongo. Just as you expect client to treat you with respect, clients hope to feel the same acknowledgement from broker. A high rating is about more than bragging right among your friends; it’s a sign that people enjoyed their time with you. Keep up the good work.</string>
